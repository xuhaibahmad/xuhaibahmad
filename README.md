Hi, I'm **Zuhaib**. A passionate and curiosity-driven Software Engineer with 7 years of experience and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

From developing mobile applications for a living to several projects across various platforms as a hobby. I have spent the last several years exploring various genres and paradigms of information technology working along with countless brilliant minds. My journey so far has included contributions to projects both as a team member and an individual contractor.

I can write clean, scalable and testable code that is easy to maintain, refactor and expand. My core expertise lies in Mobile Application Development. However, I have been regularly developing SPAs and PWAs with Vue JS, as well as Kivy apps and automation projects with Python for the past couple of years; both professionally and as a hobby.

I take pride in my work and stand by its quality. Would love to bring your idea to life and suggest best practices.

Also, I'm available on the weekends for non-profit and open source contributions. Feel free to contact me if you need assistance with any project dedicated to a social cause.
